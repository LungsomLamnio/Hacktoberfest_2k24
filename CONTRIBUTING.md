# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the spirit of Hacktoberfest and open source, we are committed to creating and maintaining a welcoming and inclusive community. We welcome contributions from people of all backgrounds and experience levels. We pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and considerate of others' ideas, opinions, and experiences.
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being empathetic and constructive in your feedback and criticism.
- Focusing on the community's well-being and the project's goals.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment or threats.
- Publishing others' private information without permission.
- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of the reporter.
